# [ui-slider](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-slider) ![ ](https://travis-ci.org/lifegadget/ui-slider.svg) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ui-ember-slider.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ui-slider) ![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/lifegadget/ui-slider/badges/gpa.svg)

> A slider control for ambitious Ember applications

## Install ##
- Modern CLI versions
    ````bash
    ember install ui-ember-slider
    ````

- Earlier CLI versions (and *addon developers*)
    ````bash
    npm install ui-ember-slider --save-dev
    ember g ui-ember-slider
    ````

> note: sadly the **npm** name `ui-slider` was already taken so for npm it has the elongated name of `ui-ember-slider` but the ember component name remains `ui-slider`

## Usage ##
For more details on the syntax check out the interactive demo:

> [ui-slider demo and examples](https://ui-slider.firebaseapp.com/)

## Dependencies
Leverages the Bower hosted jQuery plugin:

> [Bootstrap Slider](https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider)

## Version Compatibility

This may very well work with older version of Ember and Ember-CLI but it was intended for:

- Ember 1.13.7+
- Ember-CLI 1.13.7+
